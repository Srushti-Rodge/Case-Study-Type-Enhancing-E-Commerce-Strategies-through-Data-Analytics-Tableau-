Your analytical skills will be essential in examining these datasets to reveal patterns and insights that can transform e-commerce strategies, enhance customer engagement, and boost sales performance.
## Objective
Your mission is to leverage Tableau's powerful features to create an insightful narrative from the provided datasets. This will involve meticulous data preparation, strategic data modeling, and the adept use of calculated fields and Tableau functions for advanced analysis. The goal is to develop an interactive and user-friendly Tableau dashboard that highlights your key findings, delivering clear, actionable insights to optimize hotel operations and enhance performance.
